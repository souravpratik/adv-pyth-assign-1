    "Question 1: What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "solution: - In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming method that uses objects and classes in programming.           - It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "          - It promotes reusability of codes."

    "QUESTION 2: Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",

    "QUESTION 3: How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "solution : - A class object is a template for creating objects in program whereas the instance object is an instance of a                    class.\n",
    "           - A class is a logical entity while object is a physical entity.\n",
    "           - A class does not allocate memory space on the other hand object allocates memory space.\n",
    "           - we can declare class only once but can create more than one object using a class.\n",
    "           - Classes can't be manipulated while objects can be manipulated."

    "QUESTION 4: What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "solution :  The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the                 class and behaves as a pointer."

    "QUESTION 6: What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "solution :  The __init__() is a method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls                       when we create a new instance of this class. You declare other class methods like normal functions with the                     exception that the first argument to each method is self."
